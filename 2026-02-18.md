## Gatchas
- Don't install packages. Avoid it as much as you can
- moment.js, datefns 

- "Continuous Integration"
    - Trunk based only - no branches. No feature branches
    - One exception - You can't just install a package (npm, nuget, whatever)
    - If you NEED to, that must be the only thing in a pull request, and it must be approved by the entire team

"Here at Progressive"
    - All packages must be "approved" - Artifactory (JFrog)
    - Nexus (Scanning internal repos, containers, etc. for security and/or license issues)

20.1.2
    - 20 Major
    - 1 Minor
    - 2 Patch (bug fixes)

Peer dependencies
    - "Don't install *this* unless the project already has angular"
        - A version
        - "This is good for Angular 20"

## Notes
- JavaScript is painfully and thankfully single "threaded"
    - Can only focus on one program
- Any operation that could be longer than 16.667 ms can't be done synchronously
Can't do
    - Calling an API
        ```JavaScript
        const todos = service.getTodos();
        console.log(totos);
        service.getTodoes((todos) => console.log(todos));
        ```
        "promises"
        ```JavaScript
        const p = service.getTodos();
        p.then(todos => console.log(todos));
        p.catch(err => ...);
        console.log('tacos');
        ```
        Then we go async / await
        ```JavaScript
        const todos = await await.service.getTodos();
        console.log(todos);
        ```
        "Reactive Extensions" = "RxJS" - Library - You can only fulfil or reject promise **once**.
        - "Give me all the customers in co that owe > 3000"
            - Returns initial results (initial state)
            - "There is a subject that we observe over time"

Why signals?
    - Real-time change detection

AngularJs -----> Angular 2.0
     "We are just trying to be the V in MVC" - "Keep your data in JS in sync the dom"
     Flux architecture
     Dan Abromov - "ELM" Elm Architecture - Simplified Flux architecture - "Redux"
        - Immutable global state
        - State "flows down" as read only
        - A single place that can create a new state
    - @ngrx/store - Redux with observables for angular
    - ng-redux - A wrapper around dan's redux to make it work with Angular
    - @ngrx/signal-store - A library for managing state
