- UI and Backend for the Frontend (BFF) will be handled by the same team at one point here
    1. The UI can ONLY call it's own backend
    2. Tokens (JWT) in the browser are a HUGE security risk (That's why only talk to your own backend)

- Frontend
    - Some of our job will not need APIs
    - Some of it will need to use APIs that already exist
    - Sometimes we will be "ahead of" the APIs that are being built, or are waiting for the frontend team to say what they need
- Backend
    - General purpose (Open Host) - Anybody or nobody in particular might use this api
    - Building APIs for OTHER services/apis - Internal stuff usually. Breaking stuff up
    - We will be ahead of them (They have built their consumer yet, we are sirt if "Designing it")
    - Sometimes we build stuff in reaction to specific needs by other services/uis, etc.
        - Service - A code mmodule that owns some data and the process around that. Also probably exposes a way for other's use this stuff
            - http - known (Such as making a phone call)
                - Http 1.0? - Each request/response needed a new connection
                    - Only six connections at a time
                - Http 1.1 - introduced "keep-alives"
                - Http 2.0 - (UDP) - Multiple requests are almost the same "cost" as a single request
                - Http 3.0 (current) - 
            - grpc (Keep them on the phone in case I need something)
                - TCP - Needs a connection between the client and the server
                - UDP - Connection less - Fire and forget
            - messaging queue event stream (Send me an email, "this meeting could have been an email")

## Angular 2
- The router stunk. It was a mess
- The AngularJS router stunk, too. Turns out routers are hard
- There was a "community" router for AngularJS that everyone used instead

- Viktor Savkin

We were on Angular 2.0.0 - Angular Router 3.0.0

### Forms
- Template Driven Forms - There from day 1 - You just put a lot of junk in your template (.html) file
- Reactive Forms - Way more code (in a good way) - Very observable dependent. Too much so
- Signal Based Forms - Still experimental, probably out as "stable" this summer
    - REALLY GOOD!
