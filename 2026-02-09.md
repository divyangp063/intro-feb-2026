1. "Muddiest Moment" - At the end of each day look at your notes and identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of #1 below. Before you leave for the day - do this.

2. Every morning after today we will start with me asking a random selection of you this question
    - What do you remember that was helpful from yesterday?
    -> Keyboard shortcuts, how to create style Markdown files. 
    -> How to show preview: `ctrl+shift+v`
    - What was cool and you want to know more about?


Jeff talked about [[Markdown]]

Cool Extensions:
    1. Foam - VS Code Markdown
    2. Excalidraw - Similar to draw.io/Mural to draw schemas


Notes:
TFS - Team Foundation Server - A Microsoft tool for source code control.
    - It is centralized version control. It is not the best.
    - No local copy of the source code history, if internet is down, oh well can't do anything.
Git - Decentralized - ANARCHY!!! You aren't the boss of me.
    - Everybody has a copy of the code, including code history.
GitHub - A centralized repository for all your projects. Not used to be MicroSoft, but now it is.
Azure DevOps - Supports CI/CD (Continuous Improvement Continuous Deployment)


What do you store in git?   (Read about Twelve Factor App)
    - Code that you and your team OWN and change
    - Don't store other stuff there
        - Libraries you use (dlls, etc.) - Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
        - Other teams code
        - Even things like images, stuff like that - have to be careful

.NET - Even for long term support (3 years), odd for short term

- How can I have all source code AND all the history on every machine?
    - You have the current version you've fetched
    - You have "Deltas" (patches) of all changes
    - Usually that isn't too much


How to track changes locally:
    - `git init`, command to check if it worked: `explorer .`
    - `git add .` (For all files)
    - `git commit -m "Initial"` (For a specific message)
    - `gh repo create` - To create a repo from local on GitHub
    - `gh browse` - Opens a browser explorer with that repo on GitHub
