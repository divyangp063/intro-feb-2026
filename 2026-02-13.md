- Larry Wall
    - Creator of the PERL programming language
    - Really popular years ago in Linux/Unix - scripting language
    - About 90% of the web relied on it in the early days

    - has been called a "write only" language. The syntax is so weird and terse we can't understand

Virtues:
    - Laziness - Don't write the same code over and over again
    - Impatience - How can I optimize this?
    - Hubris - Think you can do it better all the time


## Banking

### Concepts
- Abstraction - Finding the abstract software entity - CAFO
- Coupling


## Notes for today
1. We can create our own type and methods via class implementation
    ```csharp
    public class TransactionAmount
    {
        private decimal Value { get;  }
        private TransactionAmount(decimal amount)
        {
            if (amount <= 0)
            {
                throw new InvalidTransactionAmountException();
            } else
            {
                Value = amount;
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - In this case both get and set would be private (Automatically assumed private if not present in the constructor)
2. "Stop punching in the face unless it's absolutely needed to"
3. Interfaces - write once and the class inheriting can define the methods in the "contract"
    ```csharp
    public interface ICalculateBonusesForAccounts
    {
        decimal CalculateBonusForDeposit(decimal currentBalance, decimal depositAmount);
    }

    public class StandardBonusCalculator : ICalculateBonusesForAccounts
    {
        public decimal CalculateBonusForDeposit(decimal currentBalance, decimal depositAmount)
        {
            return currentBalance >= 5000M ? depositAmount * .08M : 0;
        }

        public void DoSomething() { }
    }

    public class SuperDeluxBonusCalculator : ICalculateBonusesForAccounts
    {
        public decimal CalculateBonusForDeposit(decimal currentBalance, decimal depositAmount)
        {
            return currentBalance >= 5000M ? depositAmount * .12M : 0;
        }

        public void OtherStuff() { }
    }
    ```

Prefer Composition over Inheritance
