### 4 Rules of Simple Design
- Passes the tests (High Priority) - Meets the requirements
    - Start with making sure what you've done works
    - Given... When... Then...
- Reveals intention
    - It is more important usually to write code that is understandable by other developers than even writing what your senior year professor would give you a good grade for
- No duplication
    - "Don't Repeat Yourself" = "DRY"
    - If you have to change it then you have to change it in lots of places
        - But will you? You probably won't know all the ways in your application there is duplication, so you end up with an inconsistent system
- Fewest elements
    - Bugs scale linearly with the number of lines of code. `WE CAN'T CODE OUR WAY OUT OF BUGS`
    - Variables, decision, loops
        - Prefer functional style array manipulation in JavaScript as opposed to a good for loop. EVEN IT IS SLOWER

Database - Postgres: Great support for relational data (row and columns) and for documents (like mongodb)

Assembly (Java Metaphor) - A bunch of source code files that you run through a complier and it creates an assembly, can run on other OS
    - 1 Project = 1 Assembly in Visual Studio
    - In Java we have byte code, in .NET we have IL (Intermediate Language)
    - It also has Metadata - db of types
