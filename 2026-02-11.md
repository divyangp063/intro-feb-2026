## Quiz
1. When you compile a .NET project, it produces an _assembly_, which is a combination of metadata about the types produced, and the _IL_ (_intermediate language_) that the .NET Runtime (CLR) executes.  
    - JVM:JAVA::CLR::CLR:DotNet - Visual Basic .NET - C# - F# (OCAML)
2. The major difference between ".NET Core" and what we now call ".NET Framework" is:  
    - Core is cross platform and open source, Framework is windows only  
    - They intended to get rid of the core name. Some .NET Frameworks that will never run out of Windows.
    - .NET Framework - the non-cross platform version will never* get the version 5
3. True or **_False_**: .NET is commercial software and you must pay a license to Microsoft to develop code using .NET.  
4. True or **_False_**: .NET code must be created using Microsoft Visual Studio, though a free version is available.  
5. What is a solution in .NET?  
    - A glorified folder, holds projects. Holds configuration things  
    - FOREVER the file format for solutions was the same, and it was a **mess**. These were "*.snl" files and they had a ton  of confusing stuff in it, and would constantly cause merge conflicts that were hard to fix, etc.
    - Very recently (<6 months ago) they released a new version (*.slnx) that is much better, cleaner.
    - As of .NET 10, that is the "Default" for new projects and solutions.
6. What is the purpose of Aspire? At least as far as we are using it.  
    - Distributed Application Development. Helps us run and deploy the different applications we have in one nice place.  
    - Supports the 'best practice of Dev/Prod parity from the 12 factor app - orchestrates containers, all that stuff.
7. What are the three main things we design when designing an HTTP API?  
    - 1). Resources (endpoints).  
    - 2). Methods (actions, ie GET POST PUT DELETE)  
    - 3). Formats/Representations (req/res structures)  
8. What is meant by the term "Service" as we are using it in our development?  
    - Code that owns some data and all processes around that data.  
    - This is pretty much the definition of a "microservice" as well.
9. What is the difference between using the HTTP protocol scheme and the HTTPS protocol scheme?  
    - The s, or the encrypted later between server/client communication.  
    - HTTPS is "Transport Layer Security" - tls
        - Application Layer - HTTP; HTTPS - Asymmetric encryption, require(s/d):
            - Getting a certificate from a certificate authority
            - They allowed us to encrypt communication and ALSO verifed identity
            - You can still do that, because it is important
        - Transport (TCP/UDP) Layer
            - TCP - "Connection Oriented"
            - UDP - "Connectionless" - notifications
        - IP Layer - Routing - how one computer can send messages to one another. Big innovation at the time - routes around damage
        - Wifi / Wired Ethernet Layer - www.progressive.com for example
    - If we are deploying a website, we can use ACME, Let's Encrypt, etc. to ecrypt the site for free, and it is easy. (Certificate provider)
    - Local certificates:
        - Install a "dev certificate" that is unique to our machine, and then ask our browser (with your approval) to "trust" that certificate.
        - These do not work in any "real" environment.
10. What is a "port" in TCP networking?  
    - Port where TCP is listening to incoming requests  
    - Each application listening on a particular server that uses TCP must have a unique port.
        - There are "standard" or well-known ports:
            - http is 80
            - https is 443
            - mail (smtp - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is 25
            - sql server is 1433
            - postgres is 5432
