## Quiz
1. When you compile a .NET project, it produces an _assembly_, which is a combination of metadata about the types produced, and the _IL_ (_intermediate language_) that the .NET Runtime (CLR) executes.  
    - JVM:JAVA::CLR::CLR:DotNet - Visual Basic .NET - C# - F# (OCAML)
2. The major difference between ".NET Core" and what we now call ".NET Framework" is:  
    - Core is cross platform and open source, Framework is windows only  
    - They intended to get rid of the core name. Some .NET Frameworks that will never run out of Windows.
    - .NET Framework - the non-cross platform version will never* get the version 5
3. True or **_False_**: .NET is commercial software and you must pay a license to Microsoft to develop code using .NET.  
4. True or **_False_**: .NET code must be created using Microsoft Visual Studio, though a free version is available.  
5. What is a solution in .NET?  
    - A glorified folder, holds projects. Holds configuration things  
    - FOREVER the file format for solutions was the same, and it was a **mess**. These were "*.snl" files and they had a ton  of confusing stuff in it, and would constantly cause merge conflicts that were hard to fix, etc.
    - Very recently (<6 months ago) they released a new version (*.slnx) that is much better, cleaner.
    - As of .NET 10, that is the "Default" for new projects and solutions.
6. What is the purpose of Aspire? At least as far as we are using it.  
    - Distributed Application Development. Helps us run and deploy the different applications we have in one nice place.  
    - Supports the 'best practice of Dev/Prod parity from the 12 factor app - orchestrates containers, all that stuff.
7. What are the three main things we design when designing an HTTP API?  
    - 1). Resources (endpoints).  
    - 2). Methods (actions, ie GET POST PUT DELETE)  
    - 3). Formats/Representations (req/res structures)  
8. What is meant by the term "Service" as we are using it in our development?  
    - Code that owns some data and all processes around that data.  
    - This is pretty much the definition of a "microservice" as well.
9. What is the difference between using the HTTP protocol scheme and the HTTPS protocol scheme?  
    - The s, or the encrypted later between server/client communication.  
    - HTTPS is "Transport Layer Security" - tls
        - Application Layer - HTTP; HTTPS - Asymmetric encryption, require(s/d):
            - Getting a certificate from a certificate authority
            - They allowed us to encrypt communication and ALSO verifed identity
            - You can still do that, because it is important
        - Transport (TCP/UDP) Layer
            - TCP - "Connection Oriented"
            - UDP - "Connectionless" - notifications
        - IP Layer - Routing - how one computer can send messages to one another. Big innovation at the time - routes around damage
        - Wifi / Wired Ethernet Layer - www.progressive.com for example
    - If we are deploying a website, we can use ACME, Let's Encrypt, etc. to ecrypt the site for free, and it is easy. (Certificate provider)
    - Local certificates:
        - Install a "dev certificate" that is unique to our machine, and then ask our browser (with your approval) to "trust" that certificate.
        - These do not work in any "real" environment.
10. What is a "port" in TCP networking?  
    - Port where TCP is listening to incoming requests  
    - Each application listening on a particular server that uses TCP must have a unique port.
        - There are "standard" or well-known ports:
            - http is 80
            - https is 443
            - mail (smtp - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is 25
            - sql server is 1433
            - postgres is 5432

## Questions

- 2002
    - .NET is NEW!
    - Web application are ASP.NET Web Forms
        - "Active Server Pages"
    - Distributed applications are:
        - XML Web Services (SOAP)
            - ".asmc" files
        - .NET Remoting
            - Super poorly documented
            - .NET Components
- 2008
    - Windows Communication Foundation
        - Doubling down on SOAP messaging
        - BIG DEAL
        - Our* (Progressive's) entire infrastructure was this
- 2016
    - Web Forms Suck! Replace with ASP.NET MVC!
        - Web Forms (ASP.NET web forms): Hide the fact that this is the web from the developer
        - Much closer to the metal -- you have to know HTML, all that -- but that gave you more power
    - iphone, ipad, web apps - JavaScript
    - WCF Web.Api -> ASP.Net Web.Api
- DHH - Ruby on Rails
    - He borrowed - PATTERN from the smalltalk world and adopted it to the web
    - "Model View Controller"
    - This is a great model for stateful applications, but the web is stateless, so it is a little weird
        - Model
        - View
        - Controller - Traffic cop - Some code that gets the request and 
            - Either creates the model*
            - Returns a view* of that model
- We as a student look at our list of muddiest moments
    - They come from the the same place "model"
    - But *we* have a different "view" of them
    - Than the instructor will



- When our API web service is running, we have a:
    - Singleton - Kestrel Web Server - If somebody does an HTTP request, I am going to take them to the API or return an error
        - GET /todos
        - Gets request and sends the response
    - Garbage collector:
        - Non-halting
        - Generational (It's smart)
        - Still uses processor cycles since it runs on an algorithm
    -Database:
        - Entity Framework - DataContext
        - Mongo MongoContext
        - Marten - IDocumentSession
    - Database Connections
        - We don't interact with this directly
    ```
    - If your code is calling outside your API project across a network
        - Databases, other services, etc.
        - You MUST use async/await!!!!
    ```


## Database Connection
### Things we need:
1. Info to connect to database (server, credentials, etc.) - ConnectionStrings
    - Configuration (The part of our app that changes by environment)
2. Open a Connection - connectionstring.com
    - Some library/package specific for that database
    - EntityFramework - relational database (columns and rows, table defined ahead of time), easiest by far if we are following the current industry best practice - Apps don't share databases
    - Something lighter, a popular choice is "dapper"
    - NoSQL databases like MongoDB, etc. means the database is not going to enforce rules about data consistence AT ALL (Just boxes we can throw data in, no need to follow rules)
        - If you are sharing this kind of database with other applications, it's probably going to 
3. Run a Query, wait for results or Run a command
4. Close Connection
5. Process results, send response, etc.

### In Practice
1. async/await for Blocking service (DB, API, etc.)
2. Let the db provider manage connections
    - Connection Pooling (Run and disappear)
    - Networks
        - SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)

### About US
- We all have finite brains
- Some are bigger than others
- What is ours filled with?
    - Our will be, as software developer, roughly 1/2 "business" and 1/2 "code"

- If we are a library or framework, or systems programmer:
    - About 80% code
    - Performance, memory, allocation, etc.

- If we are programming in C++, we need more brain for that then we do if we are doing C#
    - This will (eventually) let us "think of our business in code"
    - For a while, it will be like 80% code, and 20% business - but eventually it'll get better
